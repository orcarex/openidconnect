## Removed Dependencies
- **django-environ**: Removed as it was imported but not actually used in the codebase
  - The import was commented out in settings.py
  - No functionality was lost by removing this dependency

## Configuration Changes

### Settings Updates
1. **ALLOWED_HOSTS**: Updated to include test server hosts for proper testing
   ```python
   ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['localhost', '127.0.0.1', 'testserver', '0.0.0.0']
   ```

2. **django-environ removal**: Cleaned up unused import and added documentation comment
   ```python
   # Note: django-environ was removed as it was not being used
   # If you need environment variable support in the future, uncomment the following:
   # import environ
   ```

### File Renames
- `test_client.py` → `websocket_client_example.py`
- `test_server.py` → `websocket_server_example.py`
- These were renamed to avoid conflicts with Django's test discovery system

## Testing & Verification

### Compatibility Tests Passed
- ✅ Django system check (no issues)
- ✅ Database migrations work correctly
- ✅ Development server starts successfully
- ✅ OAuth2 provider functionality verified
- ✅ All authentication packages import correctly
- ✅ REST framework endpoints accessible

### Security Warnings
The `--deploy` check shows standard security warnings for development environments:
- DEBUG=True (expected for development)
- Missing HTTPS settings (expected for development)
- These are normal for development and don't affect functionality
